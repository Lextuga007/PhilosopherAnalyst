      "contents": "\r\nThis was the first blog site I set up using {distill} and I’ve kept this for technical posts. The pictures I use here are my own that I’ve taken on my rambles.\r\nMy second blog site was build using Hugo Apéro which is also called Philosopher Analyst but is published through Netlify. It is where I post less technical blogs as well as host the R training materials I use for the NHS-R Community as some organisations block access to GitHub. Interestingly, others block Netlify, but not GitHub, which is why I have copied the prework for courses on my {distill} site.\r\nBlogs I’ve contributed to\r\nI am a Senior Fellow of the NHS-R Community and have written a few blogs for the community and I worked for the CDU Data Science Team in Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust until 2022 as a Data Scientist where I contributed to the team’s blog.\r\nWhy Philosopher Analyst?\r\nI studied Philosophy many years ago and had no idea about analysis or programming but I was lucky to get a chance to work with some A&E data in one job and was hooked on data from then on. I started out using SQL and my journey into learning R started around the same time as NHS-R Community started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
