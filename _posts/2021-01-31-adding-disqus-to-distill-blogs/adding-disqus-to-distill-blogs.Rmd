# Inspiration

When searching for "distill blog doesn't show xaringan slides" I stumbled across this [blog](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2019-07-31-shrotriya2019distillpt2/) by Shamindra Shrotriya where I found that it's possible to add comments to the distill pages. 

## Issues with images

I've never used Disqus before but I followed Shamindra's blog instructions and it worked. The only thing to note is that images must be in PNG format. Thankfully I'd only included a few so I could convert them by opening them in Microsoft Paint and saving them as .PNG. 

I saved as .PNG rather than .png as @tomjemmett had had to set my files to this in the [NHS-R Community GitHub](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/Conference_2020/commit/523e51b1b7fbb3c6a0de6b88dcd27dda6cc0e5d3) to get the xaringan slides there to render. I thought it best to follow this as good practice.
