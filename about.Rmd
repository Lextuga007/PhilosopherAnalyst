I am an [NHS-R Community](https://twitter.com/NHSRCommunity) Senior Fellow and my blogs and contributions to the community are gathered together in my [main blog site](https://philosopher-analyst.netlify.app/blog/), built in Hugo Apéro.

## Why Philosopher Analyst?

I studied Philosophy many years ago and had no idea about analysis or programming but I was lucky to get a chance to work with some A&E data in one job and was hooked on data from then on. 

I started out using SQL and my journey into learning R started around the same time as NHS-R Community started. 

## Contact me

When learning about the Hugo Apéro site I was also introduced to {postcard} where I can now keep all my [contact details](https://lextuga007.github.io/contact-me/) in one place. If you are interested in learning how to do these too the workshop materials are all online at https://iyo-rstudio-global.netlify.app/collection/day01/02-postcards/.
