I am an [NHS-R Community](https://twitter.com/NHSRCommunity) Champion and have written a few blogs on R and the Community [here](https://nhsrcommunity.com/blog/author/z-turner/). I also run some of the Community's Introduction to R and R Studio courses and attended every conference, even speaking at the last couple:

[Why do I need to learn R when I can use SQL?]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eEaAxeDFRE) 1:05:07

I've also attended panels on behalf of NHS-R Community:

I am the Non-Executive Director for the [Association of Professional Healthcare Analysts](https://twitter.com/Apha_Analysts), leading specifically on equality, diversity and inclusion.

## Why Philosopher Analyst?

I studied Philosophy many years ago and had no idea about analysis or programming but I was lucky to get a chance to work with some A&E data in one job and was hooked on data from then on. 
I started out using SQL and my journey into learning R started around the same time as NHS-R Community started.
